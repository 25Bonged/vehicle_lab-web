# How to Deploy Your Brochure

You can make your brochure live and shareable in minutes using one of these free methods.

## Option 1: Netlify Drop (Easiest)
1.  Locate the **`brochure`** folder on your computer (or the `brochure_deploy.zip` file I created).
2.  Go to [app.netlify.com/drop](https://app.netlify.com/drop).
3.  Drag and drop the **`brochure`** folder onto the page.
4.  Netlify will upload it and give you a live URL (e.g., `https://random-name.netlify.app`).
5.  You can share this link immediately!

## Option 2: GitHub Pages
1.  Create a new repository on GitHub.
2.  Upload all the files inside the `brochure` folder to the repository.
3.  Go to **Settings** > **Pages**.
4.  Under **Source**, select `main` branch and click **Save**.
5.  GitHub will give you a link (e.g., `https://yourusername.github.io/repo-name`).

## Option 3: Vercel
1.  Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2.  Run `vercel` inside the `brochure` folder.
3.  Follow the prompts to deploy.
