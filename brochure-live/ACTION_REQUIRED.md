# ⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED - SSL Certificate Renewal

## Current Status

✅ **DNS:** Correctly configured (verified)
- `vehiclelab.in` → Netlify IPs ✅
- `www.vehiclelab.in` → Netlify subdomain ✅

❌ **SSL Certificate:** Not working (needs renewal)
- Certificate exists but not accessible
- Needs to be renewed in Netlify dashboard

---

## What You Need to Do (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Renew SSL Certificate

**Go to Netlify and click one button:**

1. Open: https://app.netlify.com/projects/vehiclelab/configuration/domains
2. Scroll down to **"HTTPS"** section
3. Click the **"Renew certificate"** button
4. Wait 5-15 minutes
5. Done! ✅

**That's it!** This will fix your SSL error.

---

## After Renewal

1. **Wait 15 minutes** for certificate to renew
2. **Clear browser cache:**
   - `chrome://net-internals/#hsts`
   - Delete: `vehiclelab.in` and `www.vehiclelab.in`
3. **Test:**
   - Visit: `https://vehiclelab.in` (should work!)
   - Visit: `https://www.vehiclelab.in` (should work!)

---

## Why This Happens

- Your SSL certificate was created on Dec 3 (old)
- It doesn't match your current DNS setup
- Renewing creates a fresh certificate that matches current configuration

---

## Verification

After renewal, run this to verify:

```bash
cd /Users/chayan/Documents/brochure
./check_ssl.sh
```

Should show certificate details instead of "SSL connection failed".

---

## Summary

**Everything is configured correctly except the SSL certificate needs renewal.**

**Action:** Click "Renew certificate" in Netlify dashboard → Wait 15 minutes → Test site

That's all you need to do! 🚀
