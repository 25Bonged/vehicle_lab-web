# VEHICLELAB - Vehicle Diagnostic Lab

A comprehensive fleet diagnostics tool for analyzing vehicle MDF/MF4 files with advanced features for gear hunting detection, misfire analysis, fuel consumption monitoring, and more.

## Features

- **Gear Hunting Analysis**: Advanced multi-signal correlation with Speed, RPM, and Misfire integration
- **Misfire Detection**: OEM-level detection using multiple algorithms (crankshaft variance, FFT, statistical, angular velocity, wavelet, ML-based)
- **Fuel Consumption Analysis**: BSFC calculations, operating point mapping, efficiency analysis
- **Empirical Mapping**: Dynamic signal mapping across multiple OEM formats
- **Dashboard Interface**: Modern web-based dashboard with interactive Plotly visualizations

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/25Bonged/VEHICLE-LAB.git
cd backend_mdf
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Launch the dashboard:
```bash
python3 launch_dashboard.py
```

4. Access the dashboard at `http://localhost:8000`

## Usage

1. Upload your MDF/MF4 files through the web interface
2. Select analysis sections (Gear Hunt, Misfire, Fuel Consumption, etc.)
3. View interactive plots and diagnostic reports
4. Export data as CSV/Excel if needed
